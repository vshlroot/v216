abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are models that allow exact and tractable probabilistic
  inference. In contrast to neural networks, they are often assumed to be well-calibrated
  and robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we show that PCs are
  in fact not robust to OOD data, i.e., they don’t know what they don’t know. We then
  show how this challenge can be overcome by model uncertainty quantification. To
  this end, we propose tractable dropout inference (TDI), an inference procedure to
  estimate uncertainty by deriving an analytical solution to Monte Carlo dropout (MCD)
  through variance propagation. Unlike MCD in neural networks, which comes at the
  cost of multiple network evaluations, TDI provides tractable sampling-free uncertainty
  estimates in a single forward pass. TDI improves the robustness of PCs to distribution
  shift and OOD data, demonstrated through a series of experiments evaluating the
  classification confidence and uncertainty estimates on real-world data.
