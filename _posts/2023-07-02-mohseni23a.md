abstract: Neural processes are a family of probabilistic models that inherit the flexibility
  of neural networks to parameterize stochastic processes. Despite providing well-calibrated
  predictions, especially in regression problems, and quick adaptation to new tasks,
  the Gaussian assumption that is commonly used to represent the predictive likelihood
  fails to capture more complicated distributions such as multimodal ones. To overcome
  this limitation, we propose Conditional Quantile Neural Processes (CQNPs), a new
  member of the neural processes family, which exploits the attractive properties
  of quantile regression in modeling the distributions irrespective of their form.
  By introducing an extension of quantile regression where the model learns to focus
  on estimating <em>informative</em> quantiles, we show that the sampling efficiency
  and prediction accuracy can be further enhanced. Our experiments with real and synthetic
  datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in predictive performance compared
  to the baselines, and better modeling of heterogeneous distributions’ characteristics
  such as multimodality.
