abstract: 'We introduce the notion of risk-limiting financial audits (RLFA): procedures
  that manually evaluate a subset of $N$ financial transactions to  check the validity
  of a claimed assertion $\mathcal{A}$ about the transactions. More specifically,
  RLFA satisfy two properties: (i) if $\mathcal{A}$ is false, they correctly disprove
  it with probability at least $1-\delta$, and (ii) they validate the correctness
  of $\mathcal{A}$ with probability $1$, if it is true. We propose a general RLFA
  strategy, by  constructing new confidence sequences (CSs)  for the weighted average
  of $N$ unknown values,  based on samples drawn without replacement  from a (randomized)
  weighted sampling scheme.  Next, we develop methods to improve the quality of CSs
  by incorporating side information about  the unknown values. We show that when the
  side information is sufficiently accurate, it can directly drive the sampling. For
  the case where the accuracy is unknown <em>a priori</em>, we introduce an alternative
  approach using control variates. Crucially, our construction adapts to the quality
  of side information by strongly leveraging the side information if it is highly
  predictive, and learning to ignore it if it is uninformative.  Our methods also
  recover the state-of-the-art bounds for the special case of uniformly sampled observations
  with no side information, which has already found applications in election auditing.
  The harder weighted case with general side information solves the more challenging
  problem of AI-assisted financial auditing.'
