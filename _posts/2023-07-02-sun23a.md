abstract: Control variates can be a powerful tool to reduce the variance of Monte
  Carlo estimators, but constructing effective control variates can be challenging
  when the number of samples is small. In this paper, we show that when a large number
  of related integrals need to be computed, it is possible to leverage the similarity
  between these integration tasks to improve performance even when the number of samples
  per task is very small. Our approach, called meta learning CVs (Meta-CVs),  can
  be used for up to hundreds or thousands of tasks. Our empirical assessment indicates
  that Meta-CVs can lead to significant variance reduction in such settings, and our
  theoretical analysis establishes general conditions under which Meta-CVs can be
  successfully trained.
