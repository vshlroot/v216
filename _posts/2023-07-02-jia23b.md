abstract: This work models the costs and benefits of personal information sharing,
  or self-disclosure, in online social networks as a networked disclosure game. In
  a networked population where edges represent visibility amongst users, we assume
  a leader can influence network structure through content promotion, and we seek
  to optimize social welfare through network design. Our approach considers user interaction
  non-homogeneously, where pairwise engagement amongst users can involve or not involve
  sharing personal information. We prove that this problem is NP-hard. As a solution,
  we develop a Mixed-integer Linear Programming algorithm, which can achieve an exact
  solution, and also develop a time-efficient heuristic algorithm that can be used
  at scale. We conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the properties of the
  algorithms and map theoretical results to a dataset of posts and comments in 2020
  and 2021 in a COVID-related Subreddit community where privacy risks and sharing
  tradeoffs were particularly pronounced.
