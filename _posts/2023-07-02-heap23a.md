abstract: Reweighted wake-sleep (RWS) is a machine learning method for performing
  Bayesian inference in a very general class of models. RWS draws $K$ samples from
  an underlying approximate posterior, then uses importance weighting to provide a
  better estimate of the true posterior. RWS then updates its approximate posterior
  towards the importance-weighted estimate of the true posterior. However, recent
  work [Chattergee and Diaconis, 2018] indicates that the number of samples required
  for effective importance weighting is exponential in the number of latent variables.
  Attaining such a large number of importance samples is intractable in all but the
  smallest models. Here, we develop massively parallel RWS, which circumvents this
  issue by drawing $K$ samples of all $n$ latent variables, and individually reasoning
  about all $K^n$ possible combinations of samples. While reasoning about $K^n$ combinations
  might seem intractable, the required computations can be performed in polynomial
  time by exploiting conditional independencies in the generative model. We show considerable
  improvements over standard “global” RWS, which draws $K$ samples from the full joint.
