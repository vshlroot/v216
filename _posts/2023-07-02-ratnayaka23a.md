abstract: Deep graph matching techniques have shown promising results in recent years.
  In this work, we cast deep graph matching as a contrastive learning task and introduce
  a new objective function for contrastive mapping to exploit the relationships between
  matches and non-matches. To this end, we develop a hardness attention mechanism
  to select negative samples which captures the relatedness and informativeness of
  positive and negative samples. Further, we propose a novel deep graph matching framework,
  Stable Graph Matching (StableGM), which incorporates Sinkhorn ranking into a stable
  marriage algorithm to efficiently compute one-to-one node correspondences between
  graphs. We prove that the proposed objective function for contrastive matching is
  both positive and negative informative, offering theoretical guarantees to achieve
  dual-optimality in graph matching. We empirically verify the effectiveness of our
  proposed approach by conducting experiments on standard graph matching benchmarks.
