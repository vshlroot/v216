abstract: When estimating a regression model, we might have data where some labels
  are missing, or our data might be biased by a selection mechanism. When the response
  or selection mechanism is ignorable (i.e., independent of the response variable
  given the features) one can use off-the-shelf regression methods; in the nonignorable
  case one typically has to adjust for bias. We observe that privileged information
  (i.e. information that is only available during training) might render a nonignorable
  selection mechanism ignorable, and we refer to this scenario as Privilegedly Missing
  at Random (PMAR). We propose a novel imputation-based regression method, named repeated
  regression, that is suitable for PMAR. We also consider an importance weighted regression
  method, and a doubly robust combination of the two. The proposed methods are easy
  to implement with most popular out-of-the-box regression algorithms. We empirically
  assess the performance of the proposed methods with extensive simulated experiments
  and on a synthetically augmented real-world dataset. We conclude that repeated regression
  can appropriately correct for bias, and can have considerable advantage over weighted
  regression, especially when extrapolating to regions of the feature space where
  response is never observed.
