abstract: We consider the problem of sequentially maximising an unknown function over
  a set of actions while ensuring that every sampled point has a function value below
  a given safety threshold. We model the function using kernel-based and Gaussian
  process methods, while differing from previous works in our assumption that the
  function is monotonically increasing with respect to a safety variable. This assumption
  is motivated by various practical applications such as adaptive clinical trial design
  and robotics. Taking inspiration from the GP-UCB and SAFEOPT algorithms, we propose
  an algorithm, monotone safe UCB (M-SafeUCB) for this task.  We show that M-SafeUCB
  enjoys theoretical guarantees in terms of safety, a suitably-defined regret notion,
  and approximately finding the entire safe boundary. In addition, we illustrate that
  the monotonicity assumption yields significant benefits in terms of the guarantees
  obtained, as well as algorithmic simplicity and efficiency. We support our theoretical
  findings by performing empirical evaluations on a variety of functions, including
  a simulated clinical trial experiment.
