abstract: 'Transformers hold tremendous promise in solving offline reinforcement learning
  (RL) by formulating it as a sequence modeling problem inspired by language modeling
  (LM). Prior works using transformers model a sample (trajectory) of RL as one sequence
  analogous to a sequence of words (one sentence) in LM, despite the fact that each
  trajectory includes tokens from three diverse modalities: state, action, and reward,
  while a sentence contains words only. Rather than taking a modality-agnostic approach
  which uniformly models the tokens from different modalities as one sequence, we
  propose a multimodal sequence modeling approach in which a trajectory (one “sentence”)
  of three modalities (state, action, reward) is disentangled into three unimodal
  ones (three “sentences”). We investigate the correlation of different modalities
  during sequential decision-making and use the insights to design a multimodal transformer,
  named Decision Transducer (DTd). DTd outperforms prior art in offline RL on the
  conducted D4RL benchmarks and enjoys better sample efficiency and algorithm flexibility.
  Our code is made publicly here.'
