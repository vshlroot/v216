abstract: 'Significant progress has been made in developing identification and estimation
  techniques for missing data problems where modeling assumptions can be described
  via a directed acyclic graph. The validity of results using such techniques rely
  on the assumptions encoded by the graph holding true; however, verification of these
  assumptions has not received sufficient attention in prior work. In this paper,
  we provide new insights on the testable implications of three broad classes of missing
  data graphical models, and design goodness-of-fit tests for them. The classes of
  models explored are: sequential missing-at-random and  missing-not-at-random models
  which can be used for modeling longitudinal studies with dropout/censoring, and
  a  no self-censoring model which can be applied to cross-sectional studies and surveys.'
