abstract: Inference on modern Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) often relies on a variational
  inference treatment, imposing violated assumptions of independence and the form
  of the posterior. Traditional MCMC approaches avoid these assumptions at the cost
  of increased computation due to its incompatibility to subsampling of the likelihood.
  New Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process (PDMP) samplers permit subsampling, though
  introduce a model-specific inhomogenous Poisson Process (IPPs) which is difficult
  to sample from. This work introduces a new generic and adaptive thinning scheme
  for sampling from these IPPs, and demonstrates how this approach can accelerate
  the application of PDMPs for inference in BNNs. Experimentation illustrates how
  inference with these methods is computationally feasible, can improve predictive
  accuracy, MCMC mixing performance, and provide informative uncertainty measurements
  when compared against other approximate inference schemes.
