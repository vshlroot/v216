abstract: We introduce a class of networked Markov potential games where agents are
  associated with nodes in a network. Each agent has its own local potential function,
  and the reward of each agent depends only on the states and actions of agents within
  a neighborhood.  In this context, we propose a localized actor-critic algorithm.  The
  algorithm is scalable since each agent uses only local information and does not
  need access to the global state.  Further, the algorithm overcomes the curse of
  dimensionality through the use of function approximation.  Our main results provide
  finite-sample guarantees up to a localization error and a function approximation
  error. Specifically, we achieve an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\tilde{\epsilon}^{-4})$
  sample complexity measured by the averaged Nash regret. This is the first finite-sample
  bound for multi-agent competitive games  that does not depend on the number of agents.
