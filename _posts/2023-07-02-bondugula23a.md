abstract: High-dimensional data is common in multiple areas, such as health care and
  genomics, where the number of features can be tens of thousands. In such scenarios,
  the large number of features often leads to inefficient learning. Constraint generation
  methods have recently enabled efficient learning of L1-regularized support vector
  machines (SVMs). In this paper, we leverage such methods to obtain an efficient
  learning algorithm for the recently proposed minimax risk classifiers (MRCs). The
  proposed iterative algorithm also provides a sequence of worst-case error probabilities
  and performs feature selection. Experiments on multiple high-dimensional datasets
  show that the proposed algorithm is efficient in high-dimensional scenarios. In
  addition, the worst-case error probability provides useful information about the
  classifier performance, and the features selected by the algorithm are competitive
  with the state-of-the-art.
