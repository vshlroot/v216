abstract: 'Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods for numerical integration offer
  significant advantages over their non-Bayesian counterparts: they can encode prior
  information about the integrand, and can quantify uncertainty over estimates of
  an integral. However, the most popular algorithm in this class, Bayesian quadrature,
  is based on Gaussian process models and is therefore associated with a high computational
  cost. To improve scalability, we propose an alternative approach based on Bayesian
  neural networks which we call Bayesian Stein networks. The key ingredients are a
  neural network architecture based on Stein operators, and an approximation of the
  Bayesian posterior based on the Laplace approximation. We show that this leads to
  orders of magnitude speed-ups on the popular Genz functions benchmark, and on challenging
  problems arising in the Bayesian analysis of dynamical systems, and the prediction
  of energy production for a large-scale wind farm.'
