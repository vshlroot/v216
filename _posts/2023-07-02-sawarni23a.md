abstract: We study the causal bandit problem that entails identifying a near-optimal
  intervention from a specified set A of (possibly non-atomic) interventions over
  a given causal graph. Here, an optimal intervention in A is one that maximizes the
  expected value for a designated reward variable in the graph, and we use the standard
  notion of simple regret to quantify near optimality. Considering Bernoulli random
  variables and for causal graphs on N vertices with constant in-degree, prior work
  has achieved a worst case guarantee of O(N/sqrt(T)) for simple regret. The current
  work utilizes the idea of covering interventions (which are not necessarily contained
  within A) and establishes a simple regret guarantee of O(sqrt(N/T)). Notably, and
  in contrast to prior work, our simple regret bound depends only on explicit parameters
  of the problem instance. We also go beyond prior work and achieve a simple regret
  guarantee for causal graphs with unobserved variables. Further, we perform experiments
  to show improvements over baselines in this setting.
