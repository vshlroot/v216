abstract: Learning an effective global model on private and decentralized datasets
  has become an increasingly important challenge of machine learning when applied
  in practice. Existing distributed learning paradigms, such as Federated Learning,
  enable this via model aggregation which enforces a strong form of modeling homogeneity
  and synchronicity across clients. This is however not suitable to many practical
  scenarios. For example, in distributed sensing, heterogeneous sensors reading data
  from different views of the same phenomenon would need to use different models for
  different data modalities. Local learning therefore happens in isolation but inference
  requires merging the local models to achieve consensus. To enable consensus among
  local models, we propose a feature fusion approach that extracts local representations
  from local models and incorporates them into a global representation that improves
  the prediction performance. Achieving this requires addressing two non-trivial problems.
  First, we need to learn an alignment between similar feature components which are
  arbitrarily arranged across clients to enable representation aggregation. Second,
  we need to learn a consensus graph that captures the high-order interactions between
  local feature spaces and how to combine them to achieve a better prediction. This
  paper presents solutions to these problems and demonstrates them in real-world applications
  on time series data such as power grids and traffic networks.
