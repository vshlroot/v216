abstract: Off-policy methods are the basis of a large number of effective Policy Optimization
  (PO) algorithms. In this setting, Importance Sampling (IS) is typically employed
  for off-policy evaluation, with the goal of estimating the performance of a target
  policy, given samples collected with a different behavioral policy. However, in
  Monte Carlo simulation, IS represents a variance minimization approach. In this
  field, a suitable behavioral distribution is employed for sampling, allowing diminishing
  the variance of the estimator below the one achievable when sampling from the target
  distribution. In this paper, we analyze IS in these two guises in the context of
  PO. We provide a novel view of off-policy PO, showing a connection between the policy
  improvement and variance minimization objectives. Then, we illustrate how minimizing
  the off-policy variance can, in some circumstances, lead to a policy improvement,
  with the advantage, compared with direct off-policy learning, of implicitly enforcing
  a trust region. Finally, we present numerical simulations on continuous RL benchmarks,
  with a particular focus on the robustness to small batch sizes.
