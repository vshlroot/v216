abstract: 'Identifying the causes of an event, also termed as causal attribution,
  is a commonly encountered task in many application problems.  Available methods,
  mostly in Bayesian or causal inference literature, suffer from two main drawbacks:
  1) cannot attribute for individuals, and 2) attributing one single cause at a time
  and cannot deal with the interaction effect among multiple causes. In this paper,
  based on our proposed new measurement, called conditional counterfactual causal
  effect (CCCE), we introduce an individual causal attribution method, which is able
  to utilize the individual observation as the evidence and consider common influence
  and interaction effect of multiple causes simultaneously. We discuss the identifiability
  of CCCE and also give the identification formulas under proper assumptions. Finally,
  we conduct experiments on simulated and real data to illustrate the effectiveness
  of CCCE and the results show that our proposed method outperforms significantly
  state-of-the-art methods.'
