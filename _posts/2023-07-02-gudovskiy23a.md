abstract: Recent semantic segmentation models accurately classify test-time examples
  that are similar to a training dataset distribution. However, their discriminative
  closed-set approach is not robust in practical data setups with distributional shifts
  and out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. As a result, the predicted probabilities
  can be very imprecise when used as confidence scores at test time. To address this,
  we propose a generative model for concurrent in-distribution misclassification (IDM)
  and OOD detection that relies on a normalizing flow framework. The proposed flow-based
  detector with an energy-based inputs (FlowEneDet) can extend previously deployed
  segmentation models without their time-consuming retraining. Our FlowEneDet results
  in a low-complexity architecture with marginal increase in the memory footprint.
  FlowEneDet achieves promising results on Cityscapes, Cityscapes-C, FishyScapes and
  SegmentMeIfYouCan benchmarks in IDM/OOD detection when applied to pretrained DeepLabV3+
  and SegFormer semantic segmentation models.
