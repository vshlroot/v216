abstract: Multi-dimensional classification (MDC) can be employed in a range of applications
  where one needs to predict multiple class variables for each given instance. Many
  existing MDC methods suffer from at least one of inaccuracy, scalability, limited
  use to certain types of data, hardness of interpretation or lack of probabilistic
  (uncertainty) estimations. This paper is an attempt to address all these disadvantages
  simultaneously. We propose a formal framework for probabilistic MDC in which learning
  an optimal multi-dimensional classifier can be decomposed, without loss of generality,
  into learning a set of (smaller) single-variable multi-class probabilistic classifiers
  and a directed acyclic graph. Current and future developments of both probabilistic
  classification and graphical model learning can directly enhance our framework,
  which is flexible and provably optimal. A collection of experiments is conducted
  to highlight the usefulness of this MDC framework.
