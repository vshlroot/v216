abstract: We present a mixture of normalizing flows (MoNF) approach to European option
  pricing with guarantees that its estimations are free from static arbitrage. In
  contrast to many existing methods that meet economic rationality constraints (e.g.,
  non-arbitrage) by introducing auxiliary losses, our solution meets those constraints
  exactly by design. To achieve this, we propose to build a model for risk neutral
  density using normalizing flows, which results in a pricing model, instead of modelling
  the option pricing function directly. First, we convert the constraints for direct
  pricing models to the constraints for models backed by risk neutral density estimation,
  then we design a specific NF architecture that meets these constraints. Furthermore,
  we find that employing a mixture of such normalizing flows improves the performance
  significantly, compared to using a deeper single NF. Finally, we present a mechanism
  to regularise the proposed model, and this regularisation can serve as a bridge
  between our method and any sample-based mathematical finance method. The evaluations
  on five option datasets show superiority of our method compared to mathematical
  finance solutions and some other neural networks based methods. The code is available
  at \url{https://github.com/qmfin/MoNF}.
