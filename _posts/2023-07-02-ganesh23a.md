abstract: Stochastic Heavy Ball (SHB) and Nesterov’s Accelerated Stochastic Gradient
  (ASG) are popular momentum methods in optimization. While the benefits of these
  acceleration ideas in deterministic settings are well understood, their advantages
  in stochastic optimization are unclear. Several works have recently claimed that
  SHB and ASG always help in stochastic optimization. Our work shows that i.) these
  claims are either flawed or one-sided (e.g., consider only the bias term but not
  the variance), and ii.) when both these terms are accounted for, SHB and ASG do
  not always help. Specifically, for <em>any</em> quadratic optimization, we obtain
  a lower bound on the sample complexity of SHB and ASG, accounting for both bias
  and variance, and show that the vanilla SGD can achieve the same bound.
