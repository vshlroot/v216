abstract: 'Sampling subgraphs for training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is receiving
  much attention from the GNN community. While a variety of methods have been proposed,
  each method samples the graph according to its own heuristic. However, there has
  been little work in mixing these heuristics in an end-to-end trainable manner. In
  this work, we design a generative framework for graph sampling. Our method, SubMix,
  parameterizes subgraph sampling as a convex combination of heuristics. We show that
  a continuous relaxation of the discrete sampling process allows us to efficiently
  obtain analytical gradients for training the sampling parameters. Our experimental
  results illustrate the usefulness of learning graph sampling in three scenarios:
  (1) robust training of GNNs by automatically learning to discard noisy edge sources;
  (2) improving model performance by trainable and online edge subset selection; and
  (3) by integrating our framework into decoupled GNN models improves their performance
  on standard benchmarks.'
