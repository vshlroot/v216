abstract: Many kinds of simultaneously-observed <em>event sequences</em> exhibit mutually
  exciting or inhibiting patterns. Reliable detection of such temporal dependencies
  is crucial for scientific investigation. A common model is the Multivariate Hawkes
  Process (MHP), whose impact function naturally encodes a causal structure in Granger
  causality. However, the vast majority of existing methods use a transformed  <em>standard</em>
  MHP intensity with a constant baseline, which may be inconsistent with real-world
  data. On the other hand, modeling irregular and unknown background dynamics directly
  is a challenge, as one struggles to distinguish the effect of mutual interaction
  from that of fluctuations in background dynamics. In this paper, we address the
  short-term temporal dependency detection issue. We show that maximum likelihood
  estimation (MLE) for cross-impact from MHP has an error that can not be eliminated,
  but may be reduced by an order of magnitude using a heterogeneous intensity not
  for the target HP but for the interacting HP. Then we propose a robust and computationally-efficient
  modification of MLE that does not rely on the prior estimation of the heterogeneous
  intensity and is thus applicable in a data-limited regime (e.g., few-shot, unrepeated
  observations). Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our method outperforms
  existing ones by notable margins, with highlighted novel applications in neuroscience.
