abstract: Consider the problem of out-of-distribution prediction given data from multiple
  environments. While a sufficiently diverse collection of training environments will
  facilitate the identification of an invariant predictor, with an optimal generalization
  performance, many applications only provide us with a limited number of environments.
  It is thus necessary to consider adapting to distribution shift using a handful
  of labeled test samples. We propose a constrained Bayesian approach for this task,
  which restricts to models with a worst-group training loss above a prespecified
  threshold. Our method avoids a pathology of the standard Bayesian posterior, which
  occurs when spurious correlations improve in-distribution prediction. We also show
  that on certain high-dimensional linear problems, constrained modeling improves
  the sample efficiency of adaptation. Synthetic and real-world experiments demonstrate
  the robust performance of our approach.
