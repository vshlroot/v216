abstract: 'Automated curriculum generation for reinforcement learning (RL) aims to
  speed up learning by designing a sequence of tasks of increasing difficulty. Such
  tasks are usually drawn from probability distributions with exponentially bounded
  tails, such as uniform or Gaussian distributions. However, existing approaches overlook
  heavy-tailed distributions. Under such distributions, current methods may fail to
  learn optimal policies in rare and risky tasks, which fall under the tails and yield
  the lowest returns, respectively. We address this challenge by proposing a risk-aware
  curriculum generation algorithm that simultaneously creates two curricula: 1) a
  primary curriculum that aims to maximize the expected discounted return with respect
  to a distribution over target tasks, and an auxiliary curriculum that identifies
  and over-samples rare and risky tasks observed in the primary curriculum. Our empirical
  results evidence that the proposed algorithm achieves significantly higher returns
  in frequent as well as rare tasks compared to the state-of-the-art methods.'
