abstract: We focus on the learning of generalized neural policies for Relational Markov
  Decision Processes (RMDPs) expressed in RDDL. Recent work first converts the instances
  of a relational domain into an instance graph, and then trains a Graph Attention
  Network (GAT) of fixed depth with parameters shared across instances to learn a
  state representation, which can be decoded to get the policy [sharma et al., 22].
  Unfortunately, this approach struggles to learn policies that exploit long-range
  dependencies – a fact we formally prove in this paper. As a remedy, we first construct
  a novel influence graph characterized by edges capturing one-step influence (dependence)
  between nodes based on the transition model. We then define influence distance between
  two nodes as the shortest path between them in this graph – a feature we exploit
  to represent long-range dependencies. We show that our architecture, referred to
  as Symbolic Influence Network (SymNet3.0), with its distance-based features, does
  not suffer from the representational issues faced by earlier approaches. Extensive
  experimentation demonstrates that we are competitive with existing baselines on
  12 standard IPPC domains, and perform significantly better on six additional domains
  (including IPPC variants), designed to test a model’s capability in capturing long-range
  dependencies. Further analysis shows that SymNet3.0 automatically learns to focus
  on nodes that have key information for representing policies that capture long-range
  dependencies.
