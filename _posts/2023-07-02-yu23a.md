abstract: The similarity matrix measures pairwise similarities between a set of data
  points and is an essential concept in data processing, routinely used in practical
  applications. Obtaining a similarity matrix is typically straightforward when data
  points are completely observed. However, incomplete observations can make it challenging
  to obtain a high-quality similarity matrix, which becomes even more complex in online
  data. To address this challenge, we propose matrix correction algorithms that leverage
  the positive semi-definiteness (PSD) of the similarity matrix to improve similarity
  estimation in both offline and online scenarios. Our approaches have a solid theoretical
  guarantee of performance and excellent potential for parallel execution on large-scale
  data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate their high effectiveness and efficiency
  with significantly improved results over classical imputation-based methods, benefiting
  downstream applications with superior performance. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/CUHKSZ-Yu/OnMC}.
