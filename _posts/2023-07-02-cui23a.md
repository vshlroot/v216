abstract: Sequential decision-making (SDM) methods enable AI agents to compute an
  action policy toward achieving long-term goals under uncertainty. Existing research
  has shown that contextual knowledge in declarative forms can be used for improving
  the performance of SDM methods. However, the contextual knowledge from people tends
  to be incomplete and sometimes inaccurate, which greatly limits the applicability
  of knowledge-based SDM methods. In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm for
  knowledge-based SDM, called PERIL, that learns from interaction experience to reason
  about contextual knowledge, as applied to urban driving scenarios. Experiments have
  been conducted using CARLA, a widely used autonomous driving simulator. Results
  demonstrate PERIL’s superiority in comparison to existing knowledge-based SDM baselines.
