abstract: Item-to-Item (I2I) recommendation is an important function that suggests
  replacement or complement options for an item based on their functional similarities
  or synergies. To capture such item relationships effectively, the recommenders need
  to understand why subsets of items are co-viewed or co-purchased by the customers.
  Graph-based models, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), provide a natural framework
  to combine, ingest and extract valuable insights from such high-order item relationships.
  However, learning GNNs effectively for I2I requires ingesting a large amount of
  relational data, which might not always be available, especially in new, emerging
  market segments. To mitigate this data bottleneck, we postulate that recommendation
  patterns learned from existing market segments (with private data) could be adapted
  to build effective warm-start models for emerging ones. To achieve this, we introduce
  a personalized graph adaptation model based on GNNs to summarize, assemble and adapt
  recommendation patterns across market segments with heterogeneous customer behaviors
  into effective local models.
