abstract: Many machine learning applications rely on large datasets that are conveniently
  collected from existing sources or that are labeled automatically as a by-product
  of user actions. However, in settings such as content moderation, accurately and
  reliably labeled data comes at substantial cost. If a learning algorithm has to
  pay for reward information, for example by asking a human for feedback, how does
  this change the exploration/exploitation tradeoff? We study this question in the
  context of bandit learning. Specifically, we investigate Bandits with Costly Reward
  Observations, where a cost needs to be paid in order to observe the reward of the
  bandit’s action. We show that the observation cost implies an $\Omega(c^{1/3}T^{2/3})$
  lower bound on the regret. Furthermore, we develop a general non-adaptive bandit
  algorithm which matches this lower bound, and we present several competitive adaptive
  learning algorithms for both k-armed and contextual bandits.
