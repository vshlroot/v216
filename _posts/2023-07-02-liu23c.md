abstract: We study linear bandits when the underlying reward function is <em>not</em>
  linear. Existing work relies on a uniform misspecification parameter $\epsilon$
  that measures the sup-norm error of the best linear approximation. This results
  in an unavoidable linear regret whenever $\epsilon > 0$. We describe a more natural
  model of misspecification which only requires the approximation error at each input
  $x$ to be proportional to the suboptimality gap at $x$.  It captures the intuition
  that, for optimization problems, near-optimal regions should matter more and we
  can tolerate larger approximation errors in suboptimal regions. Quite surprisingly,
  we show that the classical LinUCB algorithm — designed for the realizable case —
  is automatically robust against such gap-adjusted misspecification.  It achieves
  a near-optimal $\sqrt{T}$ regret for problems that the best-known regret is almost
  linear in time horizon $T$. Technically, our proof relies on a novel self-bounding
  argument that bounds the part of the regret due to misspecification by the regret
  itself.
