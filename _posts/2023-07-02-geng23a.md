abstract: In dynamic discrete choice models, a commonly studied problem is estimating
  parameters of agent reward functions (also known as ’structural’ parameters) using
  agent behavioral data. This task is also known as inverse reinforcement learning.
  Maximum likelihood estimation for such models requires dynamic programming, which
  is limited by the curse of dimensionality [Bellman, 1957]. In this work, we present
  a novel algorithm that provides a data-driven method for selecting and aggregating
  states, which lowers the computational and sample complexity of estimation. Our
  method works in two stages. First, we estimate agent Qfunctions, and leverage them
  alongside a clustering algorithm to select a subset of states that are most pivotal
  for driving changes in Q-functions. Second, with these selected "aggregated" states,
  we conduct maximum likelihood estimation using a popular nested fixed-point algorithm
  [Rust, 1987]. The proposed two-stage approach mitigates the curse of dimensionality
  by reducing the problem dimension. Theoretically, we derive finite-sample bounds
  on the associated estimation error, which also characterize the trade-off of computational
  complexity, estimation error, and sample complexity. We demonstrate the empirical
  performance of the algorithm in two classic dynamic discrete choice estimation applications.
