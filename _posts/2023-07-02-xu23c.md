abstract: Imitation learning (IL) has proven to be an effective method for learning
  good policies from expert demonstrations. Adversarial imitation learning (AIL),
  a subset of IL methods, is particularly promising, but its theoretical foundation
  in the presence of unknown transitions has yet to be fully developed. This paper
  explores the theoretical underpinnings of AIL in this context, where the stochastic
  and uncertain nature of environment transitions presents a challenge.  We examine
  the expert sample complexity and interaction complexity required to recover good
  policies. To this end, we establish a framework connecting reward-free exploration
  and AIL, and propose an algorithm, MB-TAIL, that achieves the minimax optimal expert
  sample complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} (H^{3/2} |\mathcal{S}|/\varepsilon)$
  and interaction complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} (H^{3} |\mathcal{S}|^2 |\mathcal{A}|/\varepsilon^2)$.
  Here, $H$ represents the planning horizon, $|\mathcal{S}|$ is the state space size,
  $|\mathcal{A}|$ is the action space size, and $\varepsilon$ is the desired imitation
  gap. MB-TAIL is the first algorithm to achieve this level of expert sample complexity
  in the unknown transition setting and improves upon the interaction complexity of
  the best-known algorithm, OAL, by $\mathcal{O} (H)$. Additionally, we demonstrate
  the generalization ability of MB-TAIL by extending it to the function approximation
  setting and proving that it can achieve expert sample and interaction complexity
  independent of $|\mathcal{S}|$.
