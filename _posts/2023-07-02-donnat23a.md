abstract: By recursively summing node features over entire neighborhoods, spatial
  graph convolution operators have been heralded as key to the success of Graph Neural
  Networks (GNNs). Yet, despite the multiplication of GNN methods across tasks and
  applications, the effect of this aggregation operation has yet to be analyzed. In
  fact, while most recent efforts in the GNN community have focused on optimizing
  the architecture of the neural network, fewer works have attempted to characterize  <em>(a)  the
  different classes of spatial convolution operators</em>, <em>(b) their impact on
  the geometry of the embedding space</em>, and <em>(c) how the choice of a particular
  convolution should relate to properties of the data</em>. In this paper, we propose
  to answer all three questions by dividing existing operators into two main classes
  (<em>symmetrized</em> vs. <em>row-normalized</em> spatial convolutions), and show
  how these correspond to different implicit biases on the data. Finally, we show
  that this convolution operator is in fact tunable, and explicit regimes in which
  certain choices of convolutions — and therefore, embedding geometries — might be
  more appropriate.
