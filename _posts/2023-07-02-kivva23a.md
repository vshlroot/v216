abstract: We address the problem of identifiability of an arbitrary <em>conditional
  causal effect</em> given both the causal graph and a set of any observational and/or
  interventional distributions of the form $Q[S]:=P(S|do(V\setminus S))$, where $V$
  denotes the set of all observed variables and $S\subseteq V$. We call this problem
  conditional generalized identifiability (<b>c-gID</b> in short) and prove the completeness
  of Pearl’s $do$-calculus for the c-gID problem by providing sound and complete algorithm
  for the c-gID problem.  This work revisited the c-gID problem in  Lee et al. [2020],
  Correa et al. [2021] by adding explicitly the positivity assumption which is crucial
  for identifiability. It extends the results of [Lee et al., 2019, Kivva et al.,
  2022] on general identifiability (gID) which studied the problem for  <em>unconditional</em>
  causal effects and  Shpitser and Pearl [2006b] on identifiability of conditional
  causal effects given <em>merely</em> the observational distribution $P(\mathbf{V})$
  as our algorithm generalizes the algorithms proposed in  [Kivva et al., 2022] and
  [Shpitser and Pearl, 2006b].
