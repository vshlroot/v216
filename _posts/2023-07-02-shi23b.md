abstract: As a classical problem, online optimization with switching cost has been
  studied for a long time due to its wide applications in various areas. However,
  few works have investigated the bandit setting where both the forms of the main
  cost function $f(x)$ evaluated at state $x$ and the switching cost function $c(x,
  y)$ of transitioning from state $x$ to $y$ are unknown. In this paper, we consider
  the situation when $\left(f(x_t)+\varepsilon_t,\,{c}(x_t, x_{t-1})\right)$ can be
  observed with noise $\varepsilon_t$ after making a decision $x_t$ at time $t$, aiming
  to minimize the expected total cost within a time horizon. To solve this problem,
  we propose two algorithms from a Bayesian approach,  named Greedy Search and Alternating
  Search, respectively. They have different theoretical guarantees of competitive
  ratios under mild regularity conditions, and the latter algorithm achieves a faster
  running speed. Using simulations of two classical black-box optimization problems,  we
  demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithms compared with the classical
  method.
