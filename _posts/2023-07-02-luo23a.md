abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a non-parametric model that has been
  used in many real-world applications that involve sensitive personal data (e.g.,
  healthcare, finance, etc.) from multiple data owners. To fully and securely exploit
  the value of different data sources, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving GPR
  method based on secret sharing (SS), a secure multi-party computation (SMPC) technique.
  In contrast to existing studies that protect the data privacy of GPR via homomorphic
  encryption, differential privacy, or federated learning, our proposed method is
  more practical and can be used to preserve the data privacy of both the model inputs
  and outputs for various data-sharing scenarios (e.g., horizontally/vertically-partitioned
  data). However, it is non-trivial to directly apply SS on the conventional GPR algorithm,
  as it includes some operations whose accuracy and/or efficiency have not been well-enhanced
  in the current SMPC protocol. To address this issue, we derive a new SS-based exponentiation
  operation through the idea of “confusion-correction” and construct an SS-based matrix
  inversion algorithm based on Cholesky decomposition. More importantly, we theoretically
  analyze the communication cost and the security of the proposed SS-based operations.
  Empirical results show that our proposed method can achieve reasonable accuracy
  and efficiency under the premise of preserving data privacy.
