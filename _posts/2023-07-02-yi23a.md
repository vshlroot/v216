abstract: Estimating the energetic properties of molecular systems is a critical task
  in material design. Machine learning has shown remarkable promise on this task over
  classical force fields, but a fully data-driven approach suffers from limited labeled
  data; not just the amount of available data lacks, but the distribution of labeled
  examples is highly skewed to stable states. In this work, we propose a molecular
  representation learning method that extrapolates well beyond the training distribution,
  powered by physics-driven parameter estimation from classical energy equations and
  self-supervised learning inspired from masked language modeling. To ensure reliability
  of the proposed model, we introduce a series of novel evaluation schemes in multifaceted
  ways, beyond the energy or force accuracy that has been dominantly used. From extensive
  experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in discovering
  molecular structures, outperforming other baselines. Furthermore, we extrapolate
  it to the chemical reaction pathways beyond stable states, taking a step towards
  physically reliable molecular representation learning.
