abstract: Learning causal effects is a fundamental problem in science. Anchor regression
  has been developed to address this problem for a large class of causal graphical
  models, though the relationships between the variables are assumed to be linear.
  In this work, we tackle the nonlinear setting by proposing kernel anchor regression
  (KAR). Beyond a classic two-stage least square (2SLS) estimator, we also study an
  improved variant that involves nonparametric kernel regression in three separate
  stages. We provide convergence results for the proposed KAR estimators and the identifiability
  conditions for KAR to learn the nonlinear structural equation models (SEM). Experimental
  results demonstrate the superior performances of the proposed KAR estimators over
  existing baselines.
