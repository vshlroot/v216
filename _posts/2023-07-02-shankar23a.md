abstract: Most research in deep learning has predominantly focused on the development
  of new models and training procedures. In contrast, the exploration of training
  objectives has received considerably less attention, often limited to combinations
  of standard losses. When dealing with complex structured outputs, the effectiveness
  of conventional objectives as proxies for the true objective becomes can be questionable.
  In this study, we propose that existing inference network-based methods for structured
  prediction, as observed in previous works [Tu and Gimpel, 2018, Tu et al., 2020a],
  indirectly learn to optimize a dynamic loss objective parameterized by the energy
  model. Based on this insight, we propose a method that treats the energy network
  as a trainable loss function and employs an implicit-gradient-based technique to
  learn the corresponding dynamic objective. We experiment with multiple tasks such
  as multi-label classification, entity recognition etc., and find significant performance
  improvements over baseline approaches. Our results demonstrate that implicitly learning
  a dynamic loss landscape proves to be an effective approach for enhancing model
  performance in structured prediction tasks.
