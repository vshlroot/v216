abstract: Adequate uncertainty representation and quantification have become imperative
  in various scientific disciplines, especially in machine learning and artificial
  intelligence. As an alternative to representing uncertainty via one single probability
  measure, we consider credal sets (convex sets of probability measures). The geometric
  representation of credal sets as d-dimensional polytopes implies a geometric intuition
  about (epistemic) uncertainty. In this paper, we show that the volume of the geometric
  representation of a credal set is a meaningful measure of epistemic uncertainty
  in the case of binary classification, but less so for multi-class classification.
  Our theoretical findings highlight the crucial role of specifying and employing  uncertainty
  measures in machine learning in an appropriate way, and for being aware of possible
  pitfalls.
