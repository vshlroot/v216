abstract: Detecting an abrupt and persistent change in the underlying distribution
  of online data streams is an important problem in many applications. This paper
  proposes a new robust score-based algorithm called RSCUSUM, which can be applied
  to unnormalized models and addresses the issue of unknown post-change distributions.
  RSCUSUM replaces the Kullback-Leibler divergence with the Fisher divergence between
  pre- and post-change distributions for computational efficiency in unnormalized
  statistical models and introduces a notion of the “least favorable” distribution
  for robust change detection. The algorithm and its theoretical analysis are demonstrated
  through simulation studies.
