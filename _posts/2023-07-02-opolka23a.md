abstract: Graph classification aims to categorise graphs based on their structure
  and node attributes. In this work, we propose to tackle this task using tools from
  graph signal processing by deriving spectral features, which we then use to design
  two variants of Gaussian process models for graph classification. The first variant
  uses spectral features based on the distribution of energy of a node feature signal
  over the spectrum of the graph. We show that even such a simple approach, having
  no learned parameters, can yield competitive performance compared to strong neural
  network and graph kernel baselines. A second, more sophisticated variant is designed
  to capture multi-scale and localised patterns in the graph by learning spectral
  graph wavelet filters, obtaining improved performance on synthetic and real-world
  data sets. Finally, we show that both models produce well calibrated uncertainty
  estimates, enabling reliable decision making based on the model predictions.
