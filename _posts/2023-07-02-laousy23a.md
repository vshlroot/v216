abstract: The robustness of image segmentation has been an important research topic
  in the past few years as segmentation models have reached production-level accuracy.
  However, like classification models, segmentation models can be vulnerable to adversarial
  perturbations, which hinders their use in critical-decision systems like healthcare
  or autonomous driving. Recently, randomized smoothing has been proposed to certify
  segmentation predictions by adding Gaussian noise to the input to obtain theoretical
  guarantees. However, this method exhibits a trade-off between the amount of added
  noise and the level of certification achieved. In this paper, we address the problem
  of certifying segmentation prediction using a combination of randomized smoothing
  and diffusion models. Our experiments show that combining randomized smoothing and
  diffusion models significantly improves certified robustness, with results indicating
  a mean improvement of 21 points in accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art
  methods on Pascal-Context and Cityscapes public datasets. Our method is independent
  of the selected segmentation model and does not need any additional specialized
  training procedure.
